# web602PairCoding
Me and Bob pair coding to learn about the fs module and node

#### Node version for this proj is: NodeJs 10.19.0

we import the module using the require method and named the cariable fs

Then we proceed to destructure the read and write file methods from the main fs module and then import the path module.

`const fs = require('fs')`
 `{writeFile, readFile} = fs`

to begin the mini proj we wrote to a file using the writefile method and the writefilesync method from the fs module,and then we used the readfile method to read the file that we have just written to.

### Read the content of a directory
using the fs module readdir we read the contents of the current working directory using the readdir method and the process.cwd() together

### Delete file in dir using the `unlink` method
### Create a directory file in dir using the `mkdir` method
